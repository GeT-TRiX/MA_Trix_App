GOID: GO:0044421
Term: extracellular region part
Definition: Any constituent part of the extracellular region, the space external to the outermost structure of a cell. For cells without external protective or external encapsulating structures this refers to space outside of the plasma membrane. This term covers constituent parts of the host cell environment outside an intracellular parasite.
--------------------------------------
GOID: GO:0005515
Term: protein binding
Definition: Interacting selectively and non-covalently with any protein or protein complex (a complex of two or more proteins that may include other nonprotein molecules).
--------------------------------------
GOID: GO:0044710
Term: single-organism metabolic process
Definition: A metabolic process - chemical reactions and pathways, including anabolism and catabolism, by which living organisms transform chemical substances - which involves a single organism.
--------------------------------------
GOID: GO:0005576
Term: extracellular region
Definition: The space external to the outermost structure of a cell. For cells without external protective or external encapsulating structures this refers to space outside of the plasma membrane. This term covers the host cell environment outside an intracellular parasite.
--------------------------------------
GOID: GO:0065007
Term: biological regulation
Definition: Any process that modulates a measurable attribute of any biological process, quality or function.
--------------------------------------
GOID: GO:0044444
Term: cytoplasmic part
Definition: Any constituent part of the cytoplasm, all of the contents of a cell excluding the plasma membrane and nucleus, but including other subcellular structures.
--------------------------------------
GOID: GO:0044238
Term: primary metabolic process
Definition: The chemical reactions and pathways involving those compounds which are formed as a part of the normal anabolic and catabolic processes. These processes take place in most, if not all, cells of the organism.
--------------------------------------
GOID: GO:0016020
Term: membrane
Definition: A lipid bilayer along with all the proteins and protein complexes embedded in it an attached to it.
--------------------------------------
GOID: GO:0044237
Term: cellular metabolic process
Definition: The chemical reactions and pathways by which individual cells transform chemical substances.
--------------------------------------
GOID: GO:0003824
Term: catalytic activity
Definition: Catalysis of a biochemical reaction at physiological temperatures. In biologically catalyzed reactions, the reactants are known as substrates, and the catalysts are naturally occurring macromolecular substances known as enzymes. Enzymes possess specific binding sites for substrates, and are usually composed wholly or largely of protein, but RNA that has catalytic activity (ribozyme) is often also regarded as enzymatic.
--------------------------------------
GOID: GO:0071704
Term: organic substance metabolic process
Definition: The chemical reactions and pathways involving an organic substance, any molecular entity containing carbon.
