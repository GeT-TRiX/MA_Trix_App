# How to import ?

The first step is to click on the browse button to load the experimental data on the Matrix application, after the appearing of the pop-up you will have to select the files in the access path that you will find in the report produced by Yannick.  
You'll then find three distinct csv files, these files are respectively named topTableAll, pData and WorkingSet. 

The final step consist to select all the data at once and then confirm the selection by clicking on the open button.
A green message will then appear to validate the data loading with a summary table.

## Tips
You can select a region by handling the left click button if the files are stacked together, if it's not the case you can select the different files by maintening the Ctrl button and clicked on the files.

## Warning
It his highly recommanded that you dont modify these files (removed columns, change column names ...) in the aim of not disturbing the well functionning of the application.
