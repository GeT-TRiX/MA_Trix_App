cluster: 1
--------------------------------------
GOID: GO:0005575
Term: cellular_component
Definition: The part of a cell or its extracellular environment in which a gene product is located. A gene product may be located in one or more parts of a cell and its location may be as specific as a particular macromolecular complex, that is, a stable, persistent association of macromolecules that function together.
--------------------------------------
GOID: GO:0003674
Term: molecular_function
Definition: Elemental activities, such as catalysis or binding, describing the actions of a gene product at the molecular level. A given gene product may exhibit one or more molecular functions.
--------------------------------------
GOID: GO:0008150
Term: biological_process
Definition: Any process specifically pertinent to the functioning of integrated living units: cells, tissues, organs, and organisms. A process is a collection of molecular events with a defined beginning and end.
--------------------------------------
GOID: GO:0005623
Term: cell
Definition: The basic structural and functional unit of all organisms. Includes the plasma membrane and any external encapsulating structures such as the cell wall and cell envelope.
--------------------------------------
GOID: GO:0044464
Term: cell part
Definition: Any constituent part of a cell, the basic structural and functional unit of all organisms.
